Answers to questions:

1)	Two words that would hash to the same value using hashFunction1 but not hashFunction2 would be eat and ate - and also tea...extra credit for this 3rd word??? :-)
	These words would hash to the same bucket using hashFunction1 and not hashFunction2. This is because hashFunction1 uses the "folding" method to transform a key 
	into an integer.

2)	The observation from the above question makes hashFunction2 superior to hashFunction1 because hashFunction2 will result in a better distribution of the keys and 
	and less collisions. Therefore, hashFunction2 will more likely result in constant time (O(1)) operations and match key/value pairs on the first attempt versus 
	hashFunction1.
	
3)	No, it is not possible for the hashMapSize function to return different values whether you are using hashFunction1 or hashFunction2. This is because hashMapSize 
	returns the number of total links not the total number of links per bucket. HashFunction1 will most likely fill fewer buckets with more links while hashFunction2 
	will most likely fill more buckets with fewer links. However, in either case, the hashMapSize will be the same. 
	
4)	No, it is not possible for the hashMapTableLoad function to return different values based on if hashFunction1 or hashFunction2 is uese. This is because the ratio 
	that the hashMapTableLoad function returns tells nothing of the number of empty buckets. This function is only concerned about the size and capacity of the table, 
	not how many empty buckets there are in the table. 
	
5)	Yes, it is possible for the hashMapEmptyBuckets function to return different values based on which hashFunction is used. This is because the two different hash functions 
	distribute the links in the table differently. As noted in question 3, hashFunction1 will result in more empty buckets than hashFunction2. This will result in different 
	values from the hashMapEmptyBuckets function. 
	
6) 	Yes, there is a difference in the number of empty buckets when you change the table size from an even number like 1000 to a prime like 997. This is because prime numbers 
	result in a better distribution of the links in the table. A better distribution of links in the table means that there are less empty buckets and a poor distribution of 
	links in the table means that there are more empty buckets.
